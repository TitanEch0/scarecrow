# Scarecrow

With the scarecrow you get an effective solution to a plague of hares and raccoons in your garden.

Just combine a straw hat, a pumpkin and a straw dummy and the scarecrow is finished.

Added the little scarecrow, for all those who can't find pumpkins.
Hares and raccoons are less afraid of her, they dare to come within 8 blocks (default).
